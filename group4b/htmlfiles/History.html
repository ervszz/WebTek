<h1> Brief History
</h1>
<h2>
Brief history about the barangay?
June 20, 1959, R.A. 2370 or the “Barrio Charter” took effect, defining the specific powers and functions of a barrio council and also defining the barrio as a quasi-municipal corporation endowed with powers for its performance and particulars. </h2>
<h2>
January 5, 1973, P.D. 86-A was issued providing that all barangays are given a legal status and due recognition of the popular will. Thus the creation of the Ferdinand Barangay.</h2>
<h2>
In the same year (1973) former City Mayor Luis L. Lardizibal subdivided the barrio into multiple barangays. Campo Sioco district was divided into 7 barangays namely, Legarda, Phil-am, Balsigan, Santo Rosario, BGH Compound, Ferdinand Marcos, and Imelda Marcos. 
</h2>
<h2>
The barangays were named after the former president and former first lady as it was during the construction of Marcos Highway that brought up the names of the two barangays.

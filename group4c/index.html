	  <h3>What is Substance Abuse?</h3>
	  <p>According to World Health Organization, (<strong>WHO</strong>) Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including <br />
         alcohol and illicit drugs. Psychoactive substance use can lead to dependence syndrome - a cluster of behavioural, cognitive, and physiological <br />
		 phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and that typically include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, <br />
		 persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, <br />
		 and sometimes a physical withdrawal state.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Introduction to Substance Abuse</h3>
	  <p>
	  Substance abuse is pandemic in the Philippines. It varies from the abuse of seemingly harmless substances such as marijuana and alcohol to the <br />
	  abuse of street drugs like cocain and heroin, substancea abuse costs individuals substantially, and it costs the country as a whole.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of Substance Abuse</h3>
	  <p>Drugs work by stimulating various parts of the human body, including certain areas of the brain. The many different types and classifications of <br />
          drugs produce a variety of <strong>short-term</strong> effects, but the most common ones include: </p> </div>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>Increase heart rate</li>
	  	<li>Dizziness</li>
	  	<li>Mood changes</li>
		<li>Paranoia</li>
		<li>High blood pressure</li>
		<li>Tremors</li>
	  </ul>
      <p>
	  In high dosages, the risk for more dangerous effects increases, and the potential for heart attack, stroke, respiratory failure and coma increase. <br />
	  In the <strong>long-term</strong>, substance abuse may lead to mental and physical effects that will require treatment to resolve. These effects can include:
      </p>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>Paranoia</li>
	  	<li>Psychosis</li>
	  	<li>Immune deficiency</li>
		<li>Organ damage and failure</li>
	  </ul>

	  	<h3>Dependence, Abuse, and Addiction</h3>
	  	<p>While drug use often begins as a way to seek recreation, the addictive properties of drugs quickly turn a perceived outlet for fun into a constant need <br />
	  	 to remain high. This compulsion is uncontrollable and may interfere with a person's everyday life. While substance abuse comes with a great many <br /> 
	  	 side effects, ranging from mild physical side effects like nausea and dehydration to work-related consequences such as reduced productivity, one of <br />
	  	 the greatest risks of substance abuse is dependence. What might begin as the occasional bump of cocaine or hit on the bong can quickly spiral into <br />
	  	 dependence and eventually full-blown addiction. Once addiction takes hold, comprehensive treatment is needed. Even when the effects of drugs are <br />
	  	 damaging to a person's body and relationships with friends, family members and coworkers, the constant need for a substance often overcomes <br />
	  	 any rational thinking.
        </p>
	  	<h3>Understanding Overdoses</h3>
	  		<p>
			Most people who struggle with drug addiction face the issue of tolerance buildup. After continuous use, the body becomes less and less stimulated by <br />
		    the drug. This may cause a person to begin using higher dosages to obtain the same high. Although the person may not feel as high, the damaging <br />
		    properties of the drug cause the same amount of harm. If the body receives a level of drugs that it cannot tolerate, this leads to an overdose. While <br />
		    some overdoses occur after continuous use, they can also happen after one single use of a drug.<br/>
                <strong>Signs and symptoms</strong> of drug overdose include: </p>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>Trouble Breathing</li>
		    	<li>Fever and sweating</li>
		    	<li>Abnormal pulse</li>
		    	<li>Losing consciousness</li>
                <li>Change in skin color</li>
		    </ul>
      <h3>Prevention and Cure</h3>
      <img src="styles/Pics/Help.jpg" height="300" width="460" alt="Drug Dependency and Abuse">
      <p>
          If you are suffering from addiction. It is not too late to turn your life around. 
      </p>
      <h4>How Intervention Works</h4>
      <p>
          When a drug addict decides to stop using drugs, it will be difficult for the person. He/she will need professional help from psychiatrists and support <br />
          from family and friends. On the time of an intervention support groups must convince the person to consider rehabilitation. The person should be <br />
          elightened with the harmful effects of drugs and the damage that it causes.  
      </p>
      <h4>Withdrawal and Detoxification</h4>
      <p>
          Withdrawal is the state where the body adjusts to the drug-free state and purges itself of the remaining drugs in the body system. Detoxification on <br /> 
          the other hand, is the process of removing toxing substances from the body. At the start of detoxification it will be an intense time for the person. <br />
          For example, after several hours of the last dose of heroin, people suffering from opioid addiction will experience some of the withdrawal symptoms: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sweating</li>
          <li>Drowziness</li>
          <li>Depression</li>
          <li>Agitation</li>
          <li>Insomnia</li>
          <li>Runny nose</li>
        </ul>
	  <h4>Rehabilitation and Addiction Treatment Options</h4>
	  <p>An addiction specialist, doctor, or counselor can help an individual find the correct rehabilitation or treatment procedure. The process is determined by <br />
	     individual needs, so some people can benefit from outpatient programs while some thrive in inpatient programs.
		 <br/>
          The ulitmate goal is to help the patient adapt and recover into a drug-free life as easy as possible. The most common treatment procedures include: </p>
		 <ul>
		 <li>Support groups</li>
		 <li>Psychotherapy</li>
		 <li>Counseling</li>  
          </ul>

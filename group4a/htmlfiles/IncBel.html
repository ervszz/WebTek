        <h1> Absolute oneness of God the Father</h1>

        <h1>The Church Of Christ</h1>

        <p> The faithful firmly believe that the Church Of Christ is the one Christ established for the salvation of mankind. It is for the Church that Christ gave His life and thus, it is this Church that He will save on Judgment Day. (Matt. 16:18; Acts 20:28 Lamsa Translation; Eph. 5:23, 25)</p>

        <h1>Jesus Christ, the Son of God </h1>

        <p> The Iglesia Ni Cristo believes in Jesus Christ as the Son of God. God made Him Lord and Savior. He is the only Mediator of man to God. Jesus Christ is holy and a very special man but not God. (Matt. 3:17; Acts 2:36; 5:31; I Tim. 2:5; John 10:36; 8:40; Acts 2:22).</p>

        <h1>Judgment Day </h1>

        <p> The Church Of Christ believes that God appointed a day when He will judge all people through Christ. This is the day of the Second Advent of Christ, which is also the end of the world. (Acts 17:31; Jude 1:14-15; II Pet. 3:7, 10)</p>

    <div class="Padding">
        <h1>Resurrection </h1>

        <p> The resurrection of Christ is the main proof that the dead will rise. Those in Christ will rise first to be with Him forever in the Holy City. Those who are not of Christ will rise a thousand years after the first resurrection to be cast into the lake of fire. (I Cor. 15:12-13; I Thess. 4:16-17; Rev. 20:5-10; 21:1-4)</p>
